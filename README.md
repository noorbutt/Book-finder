his was a 6 month long project built during my third module at during college of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.




Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the google book api based on what they were interested in, such as 'most of the peoples want to read him or her favourite books'. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.0 and redux.





One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication and real time chat application . This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication  and chat section using Firebase or  firebsae database other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.





At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, antd , ,react-flip-move , reactstrap , and a significant amount of  , JSX, and CSS    . I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a webpack.config.js file to more fully understand the build process.
